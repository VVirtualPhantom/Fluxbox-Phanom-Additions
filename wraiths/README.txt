Wraiths are the primary source of quick hacks in the phantom system

They comprise of shell scripts that function as quickhacks to quickly carryout a predetermained action that falls into one of these 3 catagories:

OFFENSIVE - These are scripts that allow you to carry out a repeated function that attacks a target, such as cracking passcodes or carrying out DDOS attacks
RECON - These scripts allow you to quickly gather information on either a specific target or broad range, such as finding vulnerabilities for local ip's (generally non-intrusive)
PASSIVE - These are scripts that allow you to quickly set up any machine relevent actions quickly, such as activating a vpn or loading proxies

The wraith folder must be stored in the SHELL (/) this allows it to be found and access quickly by the fluxbox GUI.
There is also a file called menuDisplay.txt that should be refered to in your fluxbox menu - this file will be generated by wraithSearch so be sure not to remove them.
