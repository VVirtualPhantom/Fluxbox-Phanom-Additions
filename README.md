# Fluxbox-Phanom-Additions
Custom additions for my personal fluxbox UI. Including: custom styles and menu with built in file filtering

####################################
Wraiths set up
####################################

To set up your wraiths you need to add the wraiths folder to the root directory on your machine

Once added, enter the folder and make sure the wraithSearch file is an executable with chmod
Then create 3 folder directories called offensive passive and recon

You can now place any wraiths into these folders as you desire.

Fluxbox menu set up
####################################

Add the DisplayFiles and menu files into the .fluxbox directory in your home directory
Make sure DisplayFiles is an executable with chmod

Then add the Phantom theme into the styles folder making sure it is readable
